### Basic Statistics
>>>malloy
run: flights -> top_carriers
>>>malloy
run: flights -> by_month
>>>markdown
### Carrier Dashboard
The following is a single query that generates a dashboard showing high-level information for each carrier:
- Count of flights, number of destinations, and percentage of total in the dataset
- Table of top destinations for this carrier
- Timeseries of flights by month
- Topo-map visualizing destinations

This showcases Malloy's ability to:
- Use queries as larger building blocks to quickly analyze data
- Represent queries at a higher level of abstraction that makes them easier to write and maintain
- Inspect a dataset at multiple levels of granularity in a single query
